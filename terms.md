<h3 id="A">A</h3>

Acceptance Testing (AT)
: The testing of materials entering a construction project to verify that the materials, or products, comply with contract specifications.

Action
: A highway or transit project proposed for FHWA funding. It also includes activities such as a joint and multiple use permits, changes in access control, etc., which may or may not involve a commitment of federal funds.

Administering Agency
: The state or a city, county, other public agency, or nonprofit organizations, that advertise, opens bids, award and administer the contract. They are frequently called local agency or agency and were previously called responsible agency.

Advance Construction (AC)
: A project authorization technique that allows the Federal Highway Administration to authorize a project without obligating Federal funds. FHWA is required to fully obligate the Federal share of a Federal-aid project at the time it executes a project agreement. Under an AC authorization, FHWA approves a project as being eligible for Federal funding but does not commit to funding the project. As such, the project must meet all Federal requirements except for the requirement to obligate funds.

Affected Environment
: "The physical features, land, area, or areas to be influenced, or impacted, by an alternative alignment under consideration. This term also includes various social and environmental factors and conditions pertinent to an area."

Affecting
: Means will or may have an effect [or impact].

Allocation
: An administrative distribution of funds among the states, done for funds that do not have statutory distribution formulas.

Alteration
: An alteration, as applicable to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a change to a building or facility including roadway made by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public accommodation or commercial facility that affects, or could affect the usability of the building or facility, or part thereof. Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance including filling potholes, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.

Alternative
: One of a number of specific transportation improvement proposals, alignments, options, design choices, etc., in a defined study area. For a transportation project, alternatives to be studied normally include the no-action alternative, an upgrading of the existing roadway alternative, new transportation routes and locations, transportation systems management strategies, multi-modal alternatives, if warranted, and any combinations of the above.

American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official (AASHTO)
: AASHTO is a nonprofit, nonpartisan association representing highway and transportation departments in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It represents all five transportation modes: air, highways, public transportation, rail, and water. Its primary goal is to foster the development, operation, and maintenance of an integrated national transportation system.

American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM)
: A national technical society formed in 1902 to standardize specifications, methods of testing materials, and publish information regarding improvement of engineering materials.

Annual Anticipated DBE Participation Level (AADPL)
: The level of participation that the local agency would expect DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination and the effects of past discrimination on federal-aid contracts awarded in its jurisdiction in a given FFY. This includes an assessment of the availability for specific items of work that DBEs could reasonably be expected to compete for subcontracting opportunities on a federal-aid contract, and their likely availability for work on federal-aid contracts that will be awarded in a given fiscal year. The AADPL is not a goal that the local agency needs to achieve, but the AADPL will be used by the Department to establish a statewide overall DBE participation goal as required by Title 49 CFR, Part 26. The local agency must have an approved AADPL on file with the DLAE before federal funds can be authorized on any new federal-aid consultant or construction contract.

Annual Appropriations Act
: An action of a legislative body that makes funds available for expenditures with specific limitations as to amount, purpose, and duration. In most cases, it permits money previously authorized to be obligated and payments made, but for the highway program operating under contract authority, the appropriations act specifies amounts of funds that Congress will make available for the fiscal year, to liquidate obligations.

Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT)
: The total volume of vehicle traffic of a highway or road for a year divided by 365 days.

Applicant Funding Participation (Match)
: Local cash contributions.

Apportionment
: A statutorily prescribed division or assignment of funds. An apportionment is based on prescribed formulas in the law and consists of dividing authorized obligational authority for a specific program among the states.

Architecture
: See ITS Architecture and National ITS Architecture (NA).

Area of Potential Effect (APE)
: A term used in Section 106 (Cultural Resource studies) to describe the area in which historic resources may be affected by a federal undertaking.

August Redistribution
: The redistribution, in August of each year, of the obligation limitation from those state or programs unable to obligate their shares of the limitation to states or programs that are able to obligate more than their initial share of the limitation.

Authorization
: Formal federal process that establishes a date for which an agency can start reimbursable work for a phase(s) of a project. For the construction phase, an agency must obtain authorization prior to project advertisement. Authorization can be given by Congress, FHWA, or state depending on funding program regulations. Local agencies know they have authorization when they receive “Authorization to Proceed” from Caltrans.

Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
: The average number of vehicles two-way passing a specific point in a 24-hour period, normally measured throughout a year.

Avoidance Alternative
: A general term used to refer to any alignment proposal, which has been either developed, modified, shifted, or downsized to specifically avoid impacting one or more resources.

Class III Actions require the preparation of an EA to determine the appropriate environmental document required.

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
: One of three (3) NEPA Classes of Action which prescribes the level of documentation required in the NEPA process. EISs are Class I Actions. These are actions that significantly affect the environment and for which an EIS must be prepared.
