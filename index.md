My name is David Giongco (pronounced jeeôngkō). I'm a registered civil engineer and the Deputy Director for the [City of Chico Public Works - Engineering Department](1). Before joining the City, I was with the [California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)][2] in various positions and served in the U.S. Air Force as a [Civil Engineer Officer][3].

Throughout my career, I've been involved in the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation projects. I've had the opportunity to participate on [Federal Highway Administration][10] and [California Transportation Commission](12) to learn about multiple funding programs and policies.

More importantly, I'm a husband to a [lovely woman][4], father of two awesome girls, and an aspiring bogey-golfer.
