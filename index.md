**Hello. My name is David Giongco.**[^1]

I'm a registered civil engineer and the Deputy Director for the [City of Chico Public Works - Engineering Department](1). Before joining the City, I was with the [California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)][2] in various positions and served in the U.S. Air Force as a [Civil Engineer Officer][3].

I've constributed the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation projects. I've had the opportunity to participate in [Federal Highway Administration][4] and [California Transportation Commission][5] to learn about multiple funding programs and policies and assist regional and local agencies in delivering their projects.

More importantly, I'm a husband to a [lovely woman][6], father of two awesome girls, and an aspiring bogey-golfer.
