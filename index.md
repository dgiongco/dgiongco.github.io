***Hello. My name is David Giongco.***[^1]

I'm a registered civil engineer and the Deputy Director for the [City of Chico Public Works Engineering Department][1]. Prior to joining the City, I held various positions with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and served as a [Civil Engineer Officer][2] in the U.S. Air Force.

Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to all aspects of transportation projects, including planning, design, construction, and maintenance. I have had the valuable opportunity to collaborate with esteemed organizations such as the Federal Highway Administration and the California Transportation Commission. This collaboration has provided me with extensive knowledge of diverse funding programs and policies aimed at assisting regional and local agencies in effectively delivering their projects.

More importantly, I'm a husband to a [lovely woman][3], father of two [amazing girls][4], and an aspiring bogey-golfer.
