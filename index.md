***Hello. My name is David Giongco.***[^1]

I'm a registered civil engineer and a Deputy Director for the [City of Yuba City Public Works Department](1). Before joining the City, I was with the [California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)][2] in various positions and served in the U.S. Air Force as a [Civil Engineer Officer][3].

I've contributed to the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation projects. I've had the opportunity to work with the [Federal Highway Administration][4] and [California Transportation Commission][5] to learn about multiple funding programs and policies to assist regional and local agencies in delivering their projects.

More importantly, I'm a husband to a [lovely woman][6], father of two [awesome girls][7], and an aspiring bogey-golfer.
