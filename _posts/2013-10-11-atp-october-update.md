To update site subscribers and visitors about the Active Transportation Program, I’ve put together a screencast of a presentation that I’ve recently given to various groups. The details of the program are still underway, but my goal is to provide a general overview and update of the program.

I was going to just share a copy of my slides, but my presentation files[^fn1] by themselves aren’t usually effective for reference material. This is my first attempt with this type of media, so I appreciate any feedback.

[^fn1]: I often only use pictures, single words, or animations on my slides to supplement the points I talk about and try to communicate during presentations.
