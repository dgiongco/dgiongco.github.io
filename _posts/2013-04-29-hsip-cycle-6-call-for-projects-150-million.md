</p>

Applicants should also note that:

*   If an agency has one or more active HSIP (including HR3) projects that are flagged for not meeting delivery milestones, Caltrans will not accept HSIP applications from that agency unless the flags have been resolved prior to the application due date. For delivery requirements and project delivery status, please go to http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/HSIP/delivery_status.htm.<!--more-->

*   In MAP-21, the High Risk Rural Roads (HR3) Program is not a set-aside program, but part of the HSIP. However, due to the special rule pertaining to high risk rural road safety in MAP 21, it may be necessary to have a statewide lower B/C cutoff for HR3 eligible projects.
*   For the HSIP (Cycle 6) Call for Projects, non-infrastructure (NI) elements that support an infrastructure project are eligible to be funded including safety education, traffic enforcement, and emergency medical services. Additional guidance on applying for and implementing NI elements is available at http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/HSIP/NIelements.html.

In an effort to provide clear guidance to local agencies on how to efficiently prepare their applications, Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration, California Division (FHWA CA DIV) are hosting a webinar that will review the Cycle 6 Call-for-Projects process and documents. All agencies are encouraged to attend this <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/HSIP/training.html" target="_blank">live webinar</a> (May 16, 2013 from 10:00am &#8211; 12:00pm) or view the recording after the webinar has occurred. Participants are required to <a href="http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/webconference/viewconference.aspx?webconfid=26012" target="_blank">register</a> using the <a href="http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/webconference/viewconference.aspx?webconfid=26012" target="_blank">National Highway Institute&#8217;s Webconferencing system</a>.
