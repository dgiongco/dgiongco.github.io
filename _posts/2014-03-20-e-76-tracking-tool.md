The Division of Local Assistance recently announced a [very helpful tool][2] to track the status of authorization requests. Through this this simple interface, and your project ID, local agencies will now be able to see if their request is at the District, HQ, FHWA, or obligated. Local agencies will also be able to see if their request has been rejected.

You&#8217;ll be able to check the status of your authorization request [here][2].
