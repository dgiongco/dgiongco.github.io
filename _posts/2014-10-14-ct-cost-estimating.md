In response to questions from Commissioners about recent supplmental allocation requests at the August CTC meeting, Caltrans prepared a document titled ["Managing Construction Capital Project Budgets"](http://www.catc.ca.gov/meetings/agenda/2014Agenda/2014_10/Pinks/Tab_22_4.15.pdf) to help explain cost estimating practices and how project budgets are managed during the delivery process. In his cover letter to the Commission, Caltrans Director Malcolm Dougherty points out that results of system in place:

> The amount of project requests for additional funds in the past 6 years is less than 3 percent of the total number of projects.

The presentation of the items has been postponed to the December CTC meeting, but document can viewed [here](http://www.catc.ca.gov/meetings/agenda/2014Agenda/2014_10/Pinks/Tab_22_4.15.pdf).
