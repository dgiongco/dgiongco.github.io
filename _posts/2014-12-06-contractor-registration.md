In accordance with [Senate Bill 854 (Chapter 28, Statutes of 2014)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB854), all contractors and subcontractors bidding and performing work on Public Works Projects must:

* Register on an annual basis with the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) 
* Effective April 1, 2015, furnish electronic payroll records for new projects to the Labor Commissioner
 
[COIN #14-02, “Construction Registration with California Department of Industrial Relations”](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/COIN/COIN14-02.pdf) advises Local Agencies that must implement the following actions:

>1. For projects advertising after January 1, 2015, incorporating the following contract language (Labor Code Section 1771.1(a)) in their boiler plate/special provisions as follows: **“A contractor or subcontractor shall not be qualified to bid on, be listed in a bid proposal, subject to the requirements of Section 4104 of the Public Contract Code, or engage in the performance of any contract for public work, as defined in this chapter, unless currently registered and qualified to perform public work pursuant to Section 1725.5 . It is not a violation of this section for an unregistered contractor to submit a bid that is authorized by Section 7029.1 of the Business and Professions Code or by Section 10164 or 20103.5 of the Public Contract Code, provided the contractor is registered to perform public work pursuant to Section 1725.5 at the time the contract is awarded.”**
>
>2. Notifying DIR when awarding a public works project (regardless of funding source) using the online PWC-100 form. This notification shall occur within five (5) days of the project’s award. The following is the link to this online form: www.dir.ca.gov/pwc100ext/
>
>3. Assuring that any prime contractors and their subcontractors possess and maintain such registration with DIR in order to be awarded and to perform work on public works projects (regardless of funding source).
