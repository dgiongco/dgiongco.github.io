Some engineers assume reimbursement is automatically set by the legal pro rata permitted by a federal fund type and expect invoices to be paid at that rate.  That&#8217;s true for most projects, but inaccurate for underfunded projects.  (Just in case you were unfamiliar with the term, underfunded projects are essentially projects where local agencies are contributing more local/other funds than are required to match for their federal funds.)  The LAPM provides a good example to help explain how the reimbursement ratio is calculated for underfunded projects:

> The calculated federal reimbursement ratio is computed by dividing the amount of federal funds authorized by the total participating costs as shown on the E-76. If the local agency has obtained a better estimate of the project costs, it is the responsibility of the agency to contact the DLAE to request a revision of the E-76 to reflect the proper reimbursement ratio.

> For example, project CML – XXXX (XXX) has:
> 
> • Federal participating ratio of 100%
> 
> • Normal pro-rata share of 88.53%.
> 
> • Total estimated costs of the project are $100,000.00
> 
> • Total federal funds are $60,000.00
> 
> • The Federal Appropriation Code is Q240
> 
> • The reimbursement ratio would be: $60,000.00 / $100,000.00 = 60%
> 
> If the federal funding ($60,000) divided by the federally participating costs ($100,000) is less than the full pro-rata share (88.53%), the project is considered under funded. In this case, the progress payments must be reimbursed at the lower reimbursement ratio, which is 60%. On the final invoice, the reimbursement ratio may float up to 88.53% to allow all of the federal funds to be used as long as the total payments for the project do not exceed the total federal funds authorized.
> 
> Using the example above, project CML-XXXX (XXX) has incurred actual costs of $100,000.00. The federal reimbursement would cap at $60,000 since that was the amount requested/allocated for this project. If the project was fully funded, the federal reimbursement would have been capped at $88,530 ($100,000 x 88.53%).
