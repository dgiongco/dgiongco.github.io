The [deadline][1]<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a> to request Highway Bridge Program (HBP) authorizations reserved for this Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) has passed, and Caltrans is now advancing all projects programmed in FFY 13/14, 14/15, and 15/16.<a class="footnote" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a>  
If your local agency is ready to advance a programmed HBP project, submit your Request for Authorization as soon as possible. It’s anticipated that HBP funds will no longer be available for obligation after mid-July.<!--more-->

[^1]:    The projects programmed for FFY 12/13 are still eligible for funding, but they may lose their reservation as projects are now being advanced.
