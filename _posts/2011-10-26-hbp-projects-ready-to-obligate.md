Highway Bridge Program (HBP) projects that have funding in FFY 11/12 can now request obligation.

*   Submit your Request for Authorization (RFA) packages to your HBP coordinator (Harminder Basi:  El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento; Yolo, Michael McCollum:  Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Nevada, Sierra, Sutter, Yuba).
*   RFA packages will be reviewed while FTIP amendments are being processed by the MPOs.
*   FFY 11/12 projects should be obligated this year, prior to March 30, 2012. After this date, Caltrans will not be able to commit funds to the project.
*   The updated Fall Bridge list is anticipated to be published next week.

Please contact our HBP Coordinators &#8211; Harminder Basi  (530) 741-5122 or Michael McCollum (530) 741-5453 &#8211; with any additional questions.
