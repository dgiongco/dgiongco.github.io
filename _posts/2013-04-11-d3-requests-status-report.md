*The resource described in this post is only applicable to local agencies in District 3.*  
After all the hard work a local agency puts into preparing a Request for Authorization (RFA), a common question asked is:

> What’s the status of my RFA!?!

You can always contact your District Local Assistance Engineer, but a more efficient way to get submittal updates is to visit the [District 3 FADS Daily Status Page][1]<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a>. This page was created by our information guru, Jim Day, and is maintained to reflect the status of submitted RFAs. Project requests appear on the report after they’ve been reviewed and submitted by District 3 staff<a class="footnote" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a>.

In addition to the status of individual project requests, statistics from the last FFY are shared.

The processing time for a RFA can vary with factors such as the complexity of a project or time of the FFY, but I recommend that project managers estimate six weeks from the time of submittal for approval (two weeks for District review, two weeks for Caltrans HQ, and two weeks for FHWA review). This approval of RFAs is often accomplished faster, but it’s safe to incorporate this timeline into your project schedules.

If you’re interested in additional tools and links that can help deliver your projects, visit the [Resources][4] pages on this site.

[^2]:    If you don’t see a project you submitted in the report, it’s most likely still under review by District staff. The typical review time of a request at the District is two weeks, but can be streamlined by ensuring that a complete package is submitted.
