In an email sent to ATP stakeholders from the CTC:

> [These scoring rubrics](http://davidgiongco.com/assets/2017-ATP-scoring-rubrics.pdf) are primarily intended as a guide for the evaluators in order to encourage consistency across the evaluation teams.  Applicants may also find this document useful when preparing their applications.  Applicants should be cautioned, however, that evaluators may take other factors into consideration when scoring applications such as overall application and project quality, project context, and project deliverability.

Information for Question 1 is still being developed and will be posted on [CTC's ATP website](http://www.catc.ca.gov/programs/ATP.htm) when ready.
