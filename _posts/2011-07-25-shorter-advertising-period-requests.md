One of the important updates to the LAPM worth noting is advertising requirements for federal-aid projects. Through the LAPM update on June 10, 2011 (page 15-7), the minimum advertisement period for all federal-aid projects was stated as three weeks to match FHWA&#8217;s Construction Administration Core Curriculum. LAPM updates to discuss the process for shorter advertising period requests are still pending, but they are accomplished through a Public Interest Finding Form (Exhibit 12-F, also recently updated). To initiate a request, local agencies are required to prepare Exhibit 12-F providing justification for the DLAE&#8217;s review and approval. This process should be used only with strong justification to the DLAE. To comply with State Public Contract Code, two weeks would be the shortest allowed by Caltrans.  
For additional information regarding the advertising procedures, refer to Chapter 15 of the LAPM.
