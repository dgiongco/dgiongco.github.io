To address any concerns regarding a stop in FHWA operations and impacts to Local Assistance projects, FHWA HQ has provided the following information:

> As you are aware, a potential lapse in appropriations may occur after September 30. A lapse in appropriations will have varying impacts across the operating administrations of the Federal Department of Transportation. **FHWA will not be directly impacted because FHWA programs and operations are not supported by annual appropriations.**
> 
> FHWA will be fully operational after September 30, even if a lapse in appropriations occurs, due to the funding and authorities provided in MAP-21. FHWA employees should report to work on October 1, and routine operations, including project authorizations and reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund, will continue.
