Last August, [DOJ/DOT&#8217;s Joint Technical Assistance][1] on providing curb ramps was one of the hot topics among local agencies. The guidance was issued to clarify what types of pavement resurfacing projects triggered the installation of curb ramps and other pedestrian accessibility features. I shared a summary of the initial information webinars [here][2] where the distinction between alteration and maintenance projects were discussed. 

To further assist local agencies with understanding when their resurfacing projects require the inclusion of curb ramps, FHWA published this [video][3] on [Federal-aid Essentials for Local Agencies][4]. &#8220;Auburn Plains&#8221; provides an example of how it a local agency can comply with ADA requirements.
