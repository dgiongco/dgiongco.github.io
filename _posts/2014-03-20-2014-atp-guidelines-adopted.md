Get your applications ready!

The [guidelines][1] for the 2014 Active Transportation Program were adopted at today’s California Transportation Commission (CTC) meeting and the call for projects will be announced by Caltrans tomorrow.

Being part of the development of this program has been an awesome experience. I’ve worked on this program from different perspectives<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and have had opportunities to present to various stakeholders. I’ve collaborated with not only engineers and planners from a variety of organizations in the state, but also some of the most passionate pedestrtrian and bicycling advocates.

There’s still plenty of work to do, but adoption of the guidelines is a major milestone for the Active Transportation Program.

    I originally got the opportunity to help out at Caltrans HQ Local Assistance as the acting program manager, had a very brief return to District 3, and then got the chance to join the CTC staff to resume working on the program. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote"> ↩</a>
