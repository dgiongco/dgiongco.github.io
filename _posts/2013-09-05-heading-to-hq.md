*Update 9/5/13: Originally published on the Local Assistance Blog, but directed to remove it.*

I've been provided an opportunity to contribute at HQ Division of Local Assistance[^1]. My last day with the District 3 team will be September 12.

While I'll no longer be writing on the Local Assistance Blog, I'll continue to share news and advice that I believe are helpful at [DavidGiongco.com][1]. For those of you who reference my past posts, I've [archived][2] all my posts to the site. 

If you find my posts helpful and would like to continue receiving email notifications, you can [subscribe][3] for site updates by clicking [HERE][3]. I've published several posts during my transition:

*   [Safe Harbor Rate Approved for Consultant Contracts ][4]
*   [What Should I Submit?][5]
*   [Safe Routes to School (SR2S) Project Documents Updated][6]
*   [Considering Roundabouts][7]

Since I [created][8] the site in June 2011, subscription to the Local Assistance Blog has grown from a whopping two co-workers to, at the time this post is published, a humbling 278[^2] throughout the state[^3]. It has provided me the opportunities to meet and work with various local agencies and Districts. More importantly, the site has helped make a dent in sharing information with those committed to delivering their federal-aid projects.

Thank you to all who have subscribed and sent me positive feedback. I hope to see you all at my [site][1]!

[^1]: I'll be the acting coordinator for the Active Transportation Program, Transportation Alternatives Program, and Transportation Enhancements Program.

[^2]: That may not sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s pretty good for a *transportation* blog :-).

[^3]: There are a couple folks from other states. I didn&#8217;t forget about you!
