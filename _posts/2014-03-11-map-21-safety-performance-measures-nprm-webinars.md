The U.S. Department of Transportation has scheduled two webcast events to provide:

1.  An overview of the approach to implementation of the safety performance requirements in MAP-21; and
2.  Details of the [Safety Performance Measures Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)][1] to be published on March 11.

The webcasts will be delivered on March 13, 2014 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. PDT and will be repeated on March 17, 2014 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. PDT. Both webcasts will cover the same materials. For additional information or to register, click [here][2].
