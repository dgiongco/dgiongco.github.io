[DLA-OB 13&#8211;09][1] was issued today to announce the updated [LAPG Chapter 23 &#8211; Local Agency State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) Projects][2]. The revision reflects the [2014 STIP Guidelines][3] recently adopted by the CTC. The Office Bulletin highlights the following as the major changes to the LAPG Chapter 23:

> *   The Transportation Enhancement (TE) program was eliminated by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP&#8211;21). Existing TE projects may remain in the STIP so long as they are eligible for State Highway Account or other federal funds.
> *   Caltrans recommendation for construction allocations will include determination of Plans Specifications and Estimate (PS&E) completion, achievement of right of way and environmental clearances, and all necessary permits and agreements secured.
> *   Allocations for PS&E, right of way or construction of a federally financed project will be made only after documentation of environmental clearance under the National Environmental Policy Act.
