Despite what the LAPM (Chapter 17) states, FHWA discontinued the requirement for Exhibit 17-H (Statement of Materials and Labor Used by Contractors Involving Federal Funds FHWA &#8211; Form 47) and is no longer needed for projects.  We&#8217;ve requested that HQ update the LAPM.  Here&#8217;s a link to FHWA memo for additional info:
