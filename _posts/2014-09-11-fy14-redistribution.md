title: Redistribution of FY14 OA
---

FHWA recently issued a [Notice](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/notices/n4520230.cfm) for the redistribution of $2.1 billion [obligation authority (or limitation)](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/olsp/financingfederalaid/limit.cfm) for FY 2014.

In an email to the RTPA Group, Ray Zhang, Division of Local Assistance Chief, explains the significance to California:

> The FHWA announced August Redistribution Wednesday afternoon, and California did quite well. California received $191.2 million, which is the second-highest amount ever received by this state. Local share of the additional OA is estimated at $71.3 million.

MAP-21 provides for a redistribution each August[^august] of the obligation authority from states unable to obligate their shares to states that can. California was able to obligate all funds provided for the fiscal year and successfully demonstrated an ability to use more.

[^august]: That's why it's commonly referred to as *"August Redistribution"*.
