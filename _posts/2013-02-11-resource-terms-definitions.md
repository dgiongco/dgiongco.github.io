Whether you&#8217;re administering your first federal-aid project or considered the *expert* for your agency, the terms and acronyms used in Local Assistance and the Federal-aid Highway Program can be overwhelming. To help Federal Aid Series students understand some of the terminology, [CSU Sacramento][1] has put together a summary of the terms presented throughout the [LAPM][2]. They&#8217;ve made the resource available to everyone and it can now be <a title="Terms &&nbsp;Definitions" target="_blank" href="/terms">viewed here</a> or [downloaded here][3].  
The summary includes only a few of the common terms we use. If you would like to contribute more to the list, please add them in the comments below.
