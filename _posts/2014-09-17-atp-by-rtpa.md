title: 2014 ATP Distribution by RTPA
date: 2014-09-17
---

In prior posts ([2014 ATP Staff Recommendations](http://davidgiongco.com/2014-atp-staff-recommendations.html) and [2014 ATP Distribution](http://davidgiongco.com/atp-distribution.html)), I analyzed the 2014 ATP distribution by Caltrans District, urban/rural classification, MPO, and county. In this post, I'll break it out one more way - by Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA)[^map].

Hereâ€™s how the applications came in:

[^map]: Refer to this [MPO/RTPA map](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tpp/offices/orip/list/agencies_files/mpo_rtpa_February_2013_with_district_bnd.pdf) if you're unfamiliar with the RTPA abbreviations I used. I referred to Trinity County Transportation Commission as "TCTC" and Tuolumne County Transportation Commission as "TuCTC". No projects from Tehama County Transportation Commission (another possible use of "TCTC") were submitted.
