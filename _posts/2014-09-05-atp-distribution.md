title: 2014 ATP Distribution
---

Geographic distribution is not a factor in selecting projects in the competitive ATP, but it will be looked at in evaluation of the program. I analyzed the distribution of 2014 ATP projects (in the statewide and small urban/rural components) among the twelve [Caltrans Districts](http://www.dot.ca.gov/localoffice.htm) in a prior [post](/2014-atp-staff-recommendations.html). Here are other ways to look at how the program was distributed.

## Urban / Rural

The classification of an area in the program is defined by its population:

* Urban: Populations greater than 200,000.
* Rural[^small]: Populations of 200,000 or less.

Here's how the applications came in:

| Type  | #   | %    | Total $ | %    |
|-------|-----|------|---------|------|
| Urban | 626 | 81.2 | 847,319 | 83.1 |
| Rural | 145 | 18.8 | 170,528 | 16.7 |

* \#: Number of applications submitted
* %: Number of applications submitted / Total number of applications received for first solicitation (771)[^tarc]
* Total $: Amount (in $1,000s) of request(s)
* %: Amount of request(s) / Total request amount from applications received for first solicitation ($1,019,722)

Here's how the components were programmed:

### Statewide

| Type  | #   | %    | Total $ | %    |
|-------|-----|------|---------|------|
| Urban | 113 | 89.7 | 170,101 | 92.5 |
| Rural | 12  | 9.5  | 11,867  | 6.5  |

* \#: Number of projects awarded
* %: Number of projects awarded / Total number of projects awarded in statewide component (125)[^tarc]
* Total $: Amount (in $1,000s) awarded
* %: Amount awarded / Total amount awarded in statewide component ($183,843,000)

### Small Urban/Rural

| Type  | #   | %     | Total $ | %     |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|-------|
| Urban | N/A | N/A   | N/A     | N/A   |
| Rural | 22  | 100.0 | 37,005  | 100.0 |

* \#: Number of projects awarded
* %: Number of projects awarded / Total number of projects awarded in small urban/rural component (22)
* Total $: Amount (in $1,000s) awarded
* %: Amount awarded / Total amount awarded in small urban/rural component ($37,005,000)

## MPO

Here's how the applications came in by MPO[^mpo]:
