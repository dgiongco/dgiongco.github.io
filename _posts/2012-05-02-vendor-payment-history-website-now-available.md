Caltrans has released the Vendor Payment History website to check the status of your payments.  The new tool is located at:  http://dot.ca.gov/hq/asc/ .  
Although not exactly like the previous Local Assistance Payment System used to track submitted invoices, the Vendor Payment history website can be used to view payments issued within an 18-month period.

For additional information, [click HERE (Vendor Payment Website Notification.pdf)][1] for the notification memo from the Division of Accounting.
