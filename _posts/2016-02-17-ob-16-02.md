[DLA OB 16-02](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/DLA_OB/2016/ob16-02.pdf) was issued to provide procedures on establishing and revising the Period of Performance End Date (PPED) and Agreement End Date (AED) of a project. For a local agency, the main take-away from the bulletin is:

> The PPED is established by adding twelve (12) months to the local agencyâ€™s estimated date of completing the authorized phase of work. The completion of the Preliminary Engineering and Right of Way phases of work is estimated as the anticipated advertising date for construction. For the Construction phase of work, completion is estimated as board/council construction contract acceptance.
