The Division of Local Assistance recently published an [Office Bulletin][1] to clarify ADA Title II requirements to provide curb ramps when streets, roads, or highways are altered through certain types of resurfacing treatments.

For additional information, you can also check out my previous [post][2] about the impact from the [DOJ/DOT Joint Technical Assistance][3] issued last year.
