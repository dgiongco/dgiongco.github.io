You put a lot of hard work toward understanding the federal requirements for your project, coordinating efforts to ensure compliance, staying updated with Office Bulletins &#8230; but how are you doing when it becomes time to seek reimbursement for all your efforts?

Invoicing, unfortunately, is an important aspect of administering a federal-aid project that doesn&#8217;t get enough attention. [Chapter 5][1] of the LAPM is your primary resource for understanding the reimbursement process and other invoicing requirements, but Felicia Haslem and Ferdinand Batatan with District 3 Local Assistance have created an innovative template to help local agencies prepare their invoices.

<!--more-->

The Invoice Template that the team put together was originally shared on the Local Assistance Blog in February 2012, but since then has developed into a robust tool to help prepare invoices. Some of the features for the invoice tool include:

*   Automatic invoice formatting that complies with Local Programs Accounting requirements.
*   Calculated fields to prevent any errant inputs.
*   Adaptability for changing reimbursement rates.
*   Clear identification of federally eligible costs that cannot be reimbursed because of limiting grant funds<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.
*   Linked inputs for preparation of Exhibit 15-M.

To make this tool more effective, Felicia and Ferdinand put together detailed instructions on how to use<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> the Invoice Template.

If you&#8217;re having difficulties preparing your invoices or having invoices disputed by your [DLAE][2], I highly recommend checking out their Invoice Template. Felicia and Ferdinand<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> have put a lot of effort into this project and it has improved the invoicing process for agencies in District 3. It could do the same for yours too.

Download the Invoice Template [HERE][3] and start preparing you invoices in a preferred format for efficient review and, more importantly, payment.
