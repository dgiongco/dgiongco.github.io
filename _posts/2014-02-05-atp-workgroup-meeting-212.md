An ATP workgroup meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, February 12 at 10:30 am to provide participants a program update and [continue discussions][1]. You&#8217;ll be able to participate remotely (phone number: 636-651-3128, participant code: 254585) or attend the meeting in person (Caltrans, 1120 N Street, Room 2116, Sacramento, CA 95814).  
Additionally, volunteers are being requested to form:

*   A subgroup to assist with the development of the project application
*   A project evaluation committee(s)

The size of the groups will be limited and not everyone who submits a request will be included. The work of the project application subgroup will be reported back to the larger workgroup to provide those not included an opportunity for input.

If you wish to participate in one of the groups, please contact Douglas Remedios at Douglas.Remedios@dot.ca.gov no later than Friday, February 7.
