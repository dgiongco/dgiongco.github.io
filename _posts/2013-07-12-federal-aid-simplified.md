When I [originally shared][1] the [Federal-Aid Essentials for Local Public Agencies][2] site in August 2012, it was just launched and had some videos to demonstrate a new approach for teaching the federal-aid process. Since then, the site has been updated with <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/federal-aidessentials/indexofvideos.cfm" target="_blank">more videos and companion guides</a> and is an even better resource for local agencies to access anytime.

Modules are brief and concise &#8211; they each take less than 10 minutes to highlight key aspects of the Federal-aid Highway Program. Helpful topics to learn about include:

*   Federal-aid Program Overview
*   Civil Rights
*   Environment
*   Finance
*   Right-of-Way
*   Project Development
*   Project Construction and Contract Administration

Your Local Assistance office is still the primary resource for your federal-aid projects, but the [Federal-Aid Essentials for Local Public Agencies][2] site is one of the more innovative and effective resources available that I continuously recommend to local agencies.

Have you checked out the <a href="www. fhwa.dot.gov/federal-aidessentials" target="_blank">site</a> yet (www. fhwa.dot.gov/federal-aidessentials)? Please share your thoughts about the [Federal-Aid Essentials for Local Public Agencies][2]Â in the comments below. I&#8217;m curious to hear if you find the videos helpful.
