Another webinar regarding DOJ and DOT Joint Technical Assistance on ADA resurfacing has been scheduled for November 4. Space is limited, so register at this [LINK][1] soon if you would like to participate in the webinar.  
Here&#8217;s a copy of the announcement that was sent out:

I also put a summary together of the key points I took away from the initial webinars and guidance provided by DOJ and DOT. You can view that post from August [HERE][2].
