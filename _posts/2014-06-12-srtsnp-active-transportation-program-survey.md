The [California Safe Routes to School National Partnership][1] has put together a [survey][2] for feedback on the Active Transportation Program legislation, guidelines development, and application process. If you participated in the program as a workgroup member, applicant, or just want to share your feedback, be sure to take the [survey][2] by June 26. Results of the survey will be presented at a webinar scheduled on June 26 from 10-11am that you can register for [here][3]. Feedback from the survey will be helpful as we begin planning for the second cycle.
