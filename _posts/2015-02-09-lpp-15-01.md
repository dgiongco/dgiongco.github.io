It was posted a couple of weeks ago, but if you're responsible for administering consultant contracts for your local agency, you'll want to review [LPP 15-01 "Consultant Selection"](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/lpp/2015/lpp-15-01.pdf). As a result of last July's process review of A&E consultant selection and procurement throughout the state, [LAPM Chapter 10](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/lam/prog_p/ch10.pdf) was revised:
 
>This LPP incorporates process flow charts; clarifies existing information and provides added guidance; provides a more comprehensive and simplified checklist; and improves and removes duplicate Exhibits in LAPM Chapter 10 “Consultant Selection”. 
>
>LAPM Chapter 10 and the following Exhibits are replaced in their entirety:
>
>* 10-A:  A&E Consultant Audit Request Letter and Checklist
>* 10-B:  Suggested Consultant Evaluation Sheet
>* 10-C:  Consultant Contract Reviewers Checklist
>* 10-H:  Sample Cost Proposal (Example #1 thru #3)
>* 10-K:  Consultant Certification of Contract Costs and Financial Management System
