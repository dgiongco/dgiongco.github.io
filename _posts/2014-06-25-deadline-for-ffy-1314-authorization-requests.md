The end of the federal fiscal year is approaching and the deadline for authorization requests is coming up. At the recent [Regional Transportation Planning Agencies (RTPA)][1] meeting, the Division of Local Assistance advised participants of two key dates for ensuring that end-of-year obligations get processed:

*   **July 15**: Deadline for FTA transfer requests to [District Local Assistance Engineers (DLAEs)][2]
*   **August 1**: Deadline for Request for Authorizations (RFAs) to DLAEs

Requests submitted after these will still be reviewed and processed, but if you&#8217;re seeking authorization to proceed with your project this fiscal year (FFY 13/14), make sure to get your [packages][3] in.
