If you&#8217;re interested in the vision for California&#8217;s transportation future, check out the California Transportation Infrastructure Priorities (CTIP) workgroup&#8217;s recent report:

> The [California State Transportation Agency][1] has released the California Transportation Infrastructure Priorities (CTIP workgroup vision and interim recommendations document. Last year’s budget directed the new Transportation Agency to work with stakeholders to develop funding priorities and long-term funding options. The workgroup examined the current status of the state’s transportation system and discussed challenges that lie ahead. The interim recommendations offers both a vision for California’s transportation future and a set of immediate action items toward achieving that vision that are centered on the concepts of preservation, innovation, integration, reform and funding. A copy of the report is located [here][2].
