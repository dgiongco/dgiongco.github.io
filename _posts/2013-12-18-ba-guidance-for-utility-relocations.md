To assist local agencies with Buy America compliance on utility relocations, additional guidance has been developed by Caltrans to supplement [FHWA California Division&#8217;s guidance from July 12, 2013][1]:

*   [Implementation Guidelines][2]: Provides clarification and definitions of Buy America requirements for utility relocations.
*   [Material Certification Guidelines][3]: Provides two certification methods for demonstrating Buy America compliance for utility relocations.

For additional information, here&#8217;s a copy of the [announcement][4] sent to transportation partners and a link to the recently developed [Caltrans Buy America webpage][5].
