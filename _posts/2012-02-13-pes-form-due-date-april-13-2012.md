If you&#8217;re pursuing federal funding this fiscal year and have not initiated the NEPA process yet, please submit your PES (Preliminary Environmental Study) Form <span style="text-decoration:underline;">no later than Friday, April 13, 2012</span>. Â If your project will require environmental technical studies, however, NEPA approval by July 15th will not be likely.
