[TIME Magazine][1] highlighted the [California Household Travel Survey][2] disscussed in a recent Caltrans [press release][3]:

> **A new California Department of Transportation report shows that walking, biking, and public transportation trips have more than doubled since 2000.**
> 
> California residents, long known for taking to the freeways, have [dramatically reduced their dependency on cars][4], according to [a new report][2].
> 
> The report by the California Department of Transportation indicates that almost 23 percent of California household trips are made by walking, biking, or using public transportation, more than double the rate in 2000. The results are driven by what the department calls a “dramatic increase” in walking trips, which have jumped from about eight percent to about sixteen percent of household trips.
