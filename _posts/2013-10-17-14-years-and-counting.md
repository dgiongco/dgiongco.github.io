For the **14th** consecutive year, regions and local agencies delivered 100 percent of the annual obligation authority (OA) in California. Of the approximate $1.2 billion obligated for local assistance projects in FFY 2013, $58 million was made possible from additional OA due to successful delivery and the [August Redistribution][1].

To continue the success, Ray Zhang, Acting Division Chief of Local Assistance, has encouraged local partners to their submit Request for Authorizations (RFAs) as soon as possible in a [letter][2] sent today. He also pointed out key dates for FFY 2014:

*   April 1, 2014: Region obligation plans due to Division of Local Assistance
*   May 1, 2014: Local formula OA released (i.e. OA will become available to all projects until gone)
*   July 1, 2014: FFY 2014 RFAs due to Districts.

Keep up the great work and let&#8217;s make it 15 years in a row!
