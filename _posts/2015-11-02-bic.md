A new opportunity to leverage transportation funds was introduced with [DLA Office Bulletin 15-04](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/DLA_OB/2015/ob15-04.pdf):

> The Bridge Investment Credit (BIC) is a new element in the Highway Bridge Program (HBP) aimed at encouraging local agencies to invest in making improvements to bridges on local roads using local or other non-federal funds and receive credit to use as match funds for future HBP projects.
>
> The purpose of this Office Bulletin is to provide instructions on the Bridge Investment Credit (BIC), available to local agencies using Highway Bridge Program (HBP) funding. The BIC allows local agencies to replace, rehabilitate, and do preventive maintenance work on HBP eligible bridges using local funds, then receive credit for up to 100 percent of the eligible work. The credit, in turn, serves as the required non-Federal match for a future local Federal-Aid bridge project.
