DBE contract goal setting procedures established with [Office Bulletin 14-06](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/DLA_OB/2014/ob14-06.pdf) have been extended for another year. Local agencies will need to continue submitting their DBE contract goals (construction contracts greater than $2 million and consultant contracts greater than $500,000) to dbegoal.gfe@dot.ca.gov for review and approval prior to advertising. For contracts where a Good Faith Effort has been determined adequate to meet DBE requirements, submittal to the same address is required for Caltrans feedback prior to award to the contractor or consultant.
