Caltrans Division of Local Assistance (DLA) expects the next Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) Call-for-Projects (Cycle 6) would be announced in late March or April of 2013. The total federal funding available is expected to be between $100 million and $150 million. Caltrans DLA will be looking to fund multiple applications from each agency. For more details and updates on this call, please go to the <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/hsip.htm" target="_blank">Local &#8211; HSIP website</a>Â .  
To compete effectively and provide the greatest opportunity to improving the safety of the local road networks, it is essential for local agencies to start preparing for this upcoming HSIP Cycle 6 Call-for-Projects. Local agencies should start analyzing their roadway networks now to identify their safety needs and possible project candidates. To assist local agencies efforts, Caltrans and its partners are hosting webinars and workshops to help agencies be better prepared in competing for the federal HSIP funds. Here&#8217;s a summary of the training announcements that have been posted on the blog recently:
