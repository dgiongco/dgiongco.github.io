If you&#8217;re curious to see how the funding from the previous programs contribute to the ATP, check it out.

You&#8217;ll immediately notice that the total amount program differs than what was communicated in [AB 101][3] and [my posts][4] ($119.7M vs $129.5M). As noted in the estimate, the difference is due to the assumed obligation authority (95%) of the federal funds provided to the program. Final dollar amounts may vary based on actual apportionment and obligation authority by FHWA or any changes in Federal guidance.
