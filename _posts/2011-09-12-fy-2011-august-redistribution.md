FHWA recently issued a <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/notices/n4520211.htm" target="_blank">notice</a> to advise of the redistribution of Fiscal Year 2011 obligation authority.  California&#8217;s share this FY of August Redistribution Obligation Authority is almost $135 million &#8211; one of the highest with respect to the amount and percentage of the total the State has ever received.   The exact amount is still being calculated, but we anticipate around $50 million being redistributed to Local Programs.
