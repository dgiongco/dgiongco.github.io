TIGER 2012, a new and fast  round of TIGER funding is available.  Some aspects of TIGER 2012 will be  similar to previous rounds (e.g., selection criteria and required construction date), but the [Notice of Funding Availability][1] (NOFA) should be reviewed for details on the differences.  
The following are key dates and deadlines from the NOFA:

*   **February 13**:   Pre-apps accepted starting this date
*   **February 20**:   Pre-apps submittal deadline
*   **February 22**:   Final apps accepted starting this date
*   **March 19**:   Final apps submittal deadline

For additional information about TIGER 2012,  the District 3 point of contact is [Nieves Castro][2] (nieves_castro@dot.ca.gov, 530-741-4564).
