Caltrans Audits & Investigations, in cooperation with FHWA, has implemented a new process for indirect cost allocation plan and indirect cost rate proposal submissions. I&#8217;ve been hearing positive feedback from the local agencies I work with and you want to look at the process again if you&#8217;ve hesitated in the past.   For specific questions, please contact:  
Cities/Counties: Zilan Chen, Audit Manager, (916) 323-7877 or zilan_chen@dot.ca.gov  
MPOs/RTPAs: Teresa Greisen, Audit Manager, (916) 323-7910 or Teresa_Greisen@dot.ca.gov

Here&#8217;s additional info about the new process:  [ICAP- ICAP Submission Process][1]
