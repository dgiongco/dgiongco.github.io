One of the aspects MAP&#8211;21 emphasized when created was that it would establish a performance-based transportation program. According to the [summary][1] published by FHWA:

> Under MAP&#8211;21, performance management will transform Federal highway programs and provide a means to more efficient investment of Federal transportation funds by focusing on national transportation goals, increasing the accountability and transparency of the Federal highway programs, and improving transportation investment decision-making through performance-based planning and programming.

To help State DOTs, MPOs, RTPAs, and other practitioners apply performance management within their agency planning and programming processes, FHWA and FTA has developed the [Performance Based Planning and Programming Guidebook][2]. The [guidebook][2] describes the performance management process and provides examples of effective practices of planning and programming activities.

Additionally, the FHWA Office of Planning and FTA Office of Planning and Environment has scheduled a series of webinars to showcase their new [guidebook][2]. They&#8217;ll provide and overview of the document and key elements of the performance based planning and programming approach.
