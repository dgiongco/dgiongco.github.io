The recent hot topic regarding authorizations has been utility cover adjustments.  The requirement to include this type of work in the R/W Certification is not new, but some agencies are unaware that the adjustment of utility covers (e.g. manhole covers, water valve covers, and box lids) are considered utility relocations and require proper notification.  
If utility involvement is limited to only these type of adjustments, the new Exhibit 13-A can be used to properly summarize the notifications and relocations of utilities on the project.  Although the exhibit is new, the requirement, again, to disclose these types of relocations has been around and should have been included in the 13-B R/W Certification.
