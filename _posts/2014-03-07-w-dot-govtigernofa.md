The [U.S. Department of Transportation][1] is soliciting applications for next round Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants. The $600 million appropriated to this program are awarded projects that will have a significant impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, or a region. For agencies interested in competing for these highly competitive funds, you can find selection criteria and application requirements [here][2].

Applications are due April 28,2014. The notice advises that a registration process before submitting an application is required, and that this process usually takes 2-4 weeks to complete.
