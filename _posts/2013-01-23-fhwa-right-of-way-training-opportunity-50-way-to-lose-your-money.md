The material in this presentation is a MUST for everyone who is in any way involved in the acquisition of real property rights in connection with a Federal or Federal-aid Highway Project . . . be they Federal, State or Local employees &#8211; or contractors employed by a government agency.

This presentation contains valuable information about basic Uniform Act requirements and the need to allocate adequate project resources (esp. staff and time) to meet those requirements in order to avoid losing Federal funding for your projects!

This FREE session is very informative and presented in clear language. It applies to Right of Way professionals, transportation engineers, planning and construction project managers &#8211; virtually everyone whose job responsibilities involve, or relate to, the acquisition of real property for highway projects that contain any Federal funding whatsoever.

As indicated, the session will be offered on 3 successive dates to provide you with the greatest opportunity to participate. So take a moment, and set aside 2 hours on your calendar for 1 of these 3 dates &#8211; it will be time well spent.
