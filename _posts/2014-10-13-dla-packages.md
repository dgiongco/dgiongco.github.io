[^1]: It’s difficult to account for all project situations, but these lists should provide a general guide to a majority of request submittals and reports.

[^2]: A copy of the Emissions Benefit Calculation is required for CMAQ-funded projects. If the emission reductions are included in the FTIP project description, a copy of emissions benefit calculation is not needed.

[^3]: This type of project doesn’t lead to construction. Examples of such projects include the implementation of rideshare programs, vehicle purchases, and transportation outreach programs.

[^4]: The work plan serves in lieu of PS&amp;E package to detail the project. 

[^5]: The LAPM references LAPM Exhibit 15-N, but it has not been updated to reflect the authorization method selection.

[^6]: Visit the [Local Assistance ATP page](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/atp/) for ATP allocation requests forms.

[^7]: Include statement of the liquidated damages and/or contractor claims, if there are any.
