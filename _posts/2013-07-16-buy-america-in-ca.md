The California Division of FHWA has provided additional information on the [application of Buy America in California][1]. In the [letter][1] addressed to the Director of Caltrans, the following topics were addressed:

*   Application of Buy America and MAP-21
*   Transition Plan
*   Items subject to Buy America
*   Exemptions from Buy America
*   Minimal Amounts of Foreign Iron and Steel

I recommend reviewing the [FHWA letter][1] as it addresses the topics and questions brought up in previous posts ([Buy America Requirements &#8211; Reiteration][2], [Buy America FAQs & Resources][3], [Utilities & Buy America][4], [Buy America Transition Period][5]).
