In partnership with the American Public Works Association, FHWA launched a new and innovative resource called <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/federal-aidessentials/" target="_blank">Federal-aid Essentials for Local Public Agencies</a>. This new resource provides local public agencies a centralized hub for guidance, policies, procedures, and best practices for administering Federal-aid projects.<!--more-->

  
FHWA Administrator Victor Mendez points out the site&#8217;s main feature as a guest blogger on the <a href="http://fastlane.dot.gov/2012/08/guest-blogger-fhwa-administrator-victor-mendez-new-resources-help-agencies-keep-local-roads-moving.html" target="_blank">Fast Lane</a>:

> The website’s main feature is a library of videos covering key aspects of project development and the delivery process. Need to know more about the environmental review process? Want to make sure you’re complying with our policies on Disadvantaged Business Enterprises? It’s all there in the video library presented in clear and concise language that users can easily understand.

If you&#8217;re unable to participate in live training and seminars such as the <a href="http://www.cce.csus.edu/conferences/caltrans/localAssistance/training_trainTopic.cfm" target="_blank">Federal-Aid Series and RE Academy</a>, bookmarking and taking advantage of this new resource can help you better understand and manage your federal-aid projects.
