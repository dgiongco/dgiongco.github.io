In a new advisory released by the CTC:

> Yesterday, the California Transportation Commission (Commission) approved a reduced estimate of projected funding available for the stateâ€™s transportation program by $754 million over the next five years. The Commission's action, which was undertaken after careful review of current and projected financial information from numerous sources, marks the largest scaling back of the state's transportation program since the creation of the current funding structure nearly 20 years ago.
