The end of the Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) is approaching quickly … are you ready?  
Hopefully, you’ve already submitted a Request for Authorization (RFA) for your project. Or maybe your RFA submittal is pending the NEPA document or Right of Way Certification you began [coordinating in March][1].

If neither is the situation and you plan to obtain authorization approval in FFY 2013, you’ll need to submit your *complete*<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a> RFA to your [DLAE][2] no later than **Monday, August 12**<a class="footnote" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a>. District staff will continue to work on requests submitted after this date, but receiving authorization approval before October 1st can no longer be guaranteed.

If you have any questions or need assistance with preparing your RFA<a class="footnote" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" href="3">[3]</a>, contact your [DLAE][2].

[^2]:    The deadline may be different for local agencies if you’re not in District 3.

[^3]:    If you’re planning to transfer federal funds to FTA, hopefully you’ve submitted that request already. If not, your FTA Transfer Request needs to be submitted as soon as possible to comply with FHWA’s earlier processing time.
