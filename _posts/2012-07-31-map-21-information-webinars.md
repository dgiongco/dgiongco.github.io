> The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) invites you to participate in the first of several high-level informational outreach webinars on the recently enacted MAP-21 surface transportation authorization legislation.
> 
> As you know, this landmark bill significantly changes and modernizes the Nation’s highway program, by consolidating programs, eliminating redundant programs and processes, and shortening the highway project delivery process.
> 
> This webinar is designed to make you aware of the major changes brought about by MAP-21, and to provide a forum for beginning the national dialog FHWA wishes to have with you on questions and concerns as FHWA works to prepare for the October 1 implementation of these program changes and efficiencies. The webinar will be presented up to two more times in the next two weeks in the event you are unable to participate in the first one.
> 
> Subsequent webinars to be held later in August will concentrate on specific highway program areas. These will be followed by more detailed webinars on October 1 implementation.
> 
> This first webinar is scheduled for Thursday, August 2, 2012, from 1-3 p.m. EDT. Information on how to register for the webinar (as well as subsequent webinars) and audio dial-in instructions is available on FHWA’s MAP-21 website: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/webinars.cfm.
> 
> Note that these webinars are informational in nature and are not decisional at this time. FHWA is still in the process of interpreting this newly enacted law, and we cannot respond to interpretation questions during the webinars.
> 
> We welcome any questions you might have in advance of the webinar, including specific non-decisional questions you would like to see addressed. These questions will be used to create a question-and-answer forum which will benefit everyone interested in MAP-21 implementation.
> 
> Please visit FHWA’s MAP-21 webpage at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21.
