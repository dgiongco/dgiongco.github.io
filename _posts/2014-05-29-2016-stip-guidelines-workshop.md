The CTC will be hosting several workshops this summer to enhance transparency and accountability of programming the [State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP)][1]. Discussion at the workshops will initially focus on criteria for performance measures and the Interregional Transportation Improvement Program (ITIP), but other guidelines topics may be identified depending on participant interests.

The workshops will be similar to the workgroup meetings convened for developing the Active Transportation Program Guidelines. They will be open to all interested stakeholders at various locations throughout the state and call-in options will be provided to further accommodate those who are unable to attend in person. The first workshop is scheduled for:

Wednesday, June 11, 2014  
10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.  
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)  
1120 N Street, Room 2116  
Sacramento, CA  
Teleconference Number: 1-877-411-9748, Participant Code: 254585
