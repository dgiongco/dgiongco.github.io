title: Why 88.53?

When you become involved with federal-aid projects in California, an unusual, but commonly referred number is introduced to you: *88.53*. The odd number represents the federal share percentage on local agency RSTP and CMAQ-funded projects … but why?

Federal funds typically[^1] provide a maximum 80% of the project’s eligible cost, with the remaining 20% provided by state or local agency funding. The federal share, however, may be increased[^2] in states that contain more land under federal control. Specifically, the increased rates are available for states in which designated public lands[^3] exceed 5% of the total area of the state. Eligible states currently include Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and, you got it - California.

Adjustments to federal participation are made in accordance with the sliding scale rates provided in [FHWA Notice N 4540.12](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/notices/n4540-12.htm). Based on data from the Department of Interior, the ratio of Federal lands area to the total area in California is 0.4263. The resulting 80% plus sliding scale rate for California is **88.53%**.

Here's how it's calculated:

Hopefully, *88.53* will no longer be foreign to you.

[^1]: Example programs that provide higher federal shares are the Highway Safety Improvement Program (90%) and SAFETEA-LU Safe Routes to School Program (100%). Toll credits also provide an opportunity to increase the federal participation to 100%.
[^2]: The maximum rate of federal participation that can be adjusted with sliding scale rate is 95%.
[^3]: Areas of non-taxable Indian Lands and reserved and unreserved public domain lands inclusive of national forests and national parks and monuments.
