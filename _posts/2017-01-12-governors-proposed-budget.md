[2017-2018 Governor's Proposed Budget Summary (Transportation Chapter)](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2017-18/pdf/BudgetSummary/Transportation.pdf):

> Over the next 10 years, the Governor’s transportation package will provide almost$43 billion for transportation investments with revenues split evenly between stateand local transportation priorities. It places an emphasis on repairing and maintaining existing infrastructure with major new funding for both state highways and local roads.

Two aspects of the package that stood out to me:

* Reversing the [reduction in the STIP](http://davidgiongco.com/stip-reduction.html) that occurred last year:

> State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) — An augmentation and stabilization to the STIP, which should not only allow the California Transportation Commission to restore funding for $750 million worth of projects cut from the program in 2016, but also program approximately $800 million in new projects in the 2018 STIP.

* Comparison of highway condition with and without the Governor's Transportation Package:
