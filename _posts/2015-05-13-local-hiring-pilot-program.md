title: Local Labor Hiring Pilot Program
---

The Division of Local Assistance recently [informed]((http://davidgiongco.com/assets/local-labor-hiring-program-letter.pdf)) local agencies on how to particpate in the new [Local Labor Hiring Pilot Program](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/cqit/sep14local.cfm). The pilot program will allow local agencies to use local hiring provisions on their federal-aid projects. Any FTA- or FHWA-funded project advertised by March 5, 2016, can be considered for the pilot program.

To participate in the pilot program, local agencies will need to submit a [SEP-14][^fn1] work plan to their DLAE for forwarding to FHWA. A [template](http://davidgiongco.com/assets/pilot-a.docx) and [list of general requirements](http://davidgiongco.com/assets/pilot-a.docx) have been created to help prepare a work plan.
