In anticipation of the Obligation Authority (OA) remainder for the federal fiscal year [becoming available soon][1], the Division of Local Assistance (DLA) has opened the statewide OA pool early this year.  
To address low statewide OA delivery, **effective immediately**, regions will be able deliver above their fiscal year OA now. Regions, however, are still guaranteed 100% OA until May 1st in accordance with the OA Management policy<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a>.

*So how does this affect your project and agency?<!--more-->*

If you have a project (not identified for delivery this fiscal year) that’s ready and can be advanced, get in contact with your RTPA to discuss the opportunities in your region to request authorization of funds now.

Also noted in the Chief of DLA’s message to RTPAs was Match & Exchange agreements will proceed after the President signs the bill into law, which is expected to occur later this week.

[^1]:    According to the OA management policy, each Region’s delivery is limited  to 100% OA until May 1st . After May 1st, DLA opens up  the statewide OA pool.
