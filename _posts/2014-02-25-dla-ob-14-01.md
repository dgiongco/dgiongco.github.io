[Division of Local Assistance Office Bulletin 14-01][1] was posted today to explain the two new classes of categorical exclusions (CE) amended in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA):

*   Projects Within an Existing Operational Right-of-Way &#8211; 23 CFR 771.117(c)(22)
*   Project Receiving Limited Federal Funding &#8211; 23 CRF 771.117(c)(23)

The Office Bullentin also discusses revisions to the [Categorical Exclusion Checklist (LAPM Exhibit 6-E)][2] and the [Categorical Exemption/Categorical Exclusion Determination Form (LAPM Exhibit 6-F][3]).

These CEs, which became effective February 12, 2014, may assist in streamlining the delivery of some of your projects.
