[FHWA Stewardship and Oversight Team](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/federalaid/stewardship/170212.cfm):

>**EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY**: To improve efficiency of the agency's stewardship and oversight of projects and to reduce burden on staff resources, FHWA will no longer identify a subset of Projects of Division Interest (PoDIs) as Projects of Corporate Interest (PoCIs). From this point forward all projects that were considered PoCIs will be viewed as PoDIs or more simply, all projects of interest will be considered Projects of Division Interest (PoDIs). This action should simplify how we do business, while maintaining the effectiveness of our project involvement. Major Projects will still be identified separately and recorded in the resource deployment tool. A separate call will be sent out from the Major Projects Team to identify/verify these projects for PY18.
