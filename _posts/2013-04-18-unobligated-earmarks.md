Did you know that there is approximately **$370 million** of unobligated earmark funds in California?  
A [list of projects][1] was recently shared by the Division Chief of Local Assistance and provides details about earmarks with unobligated balances<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a>. It’s interesting to see that there are some remaining earmarks with no local match required<a class="footnote" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a> and even that have been on the books since 1991!

I recommend reviewing [the list][1] to check if your local agency was the applicant for any of these projects. Although MAP–21 eliminated earmarks, prior High Priority Projects (HPP)/Demonstration (Demo) earmarks are available until expended or rescinded by Congress. If your local agency has a proposed project<a class="footnote" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" href="3">[3]</a> that matches the legislated project description, there may be an opportunity obligate these funds.<!--more-->

[The list][1] also provides a good opportunity to contact your <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/dlae.htm" target="_blank">District Local Assistance Engineer (DLAE)</a> about any errors. If your local agency is listed as the Earmark Applicant<a class="footnote" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" href="4">[4]</a> for a project, reconcile the obligated amount with your records. Or if your local agency is listed incorrectly as the applicant, let your DLAE know so the appropriate information can be updated in the Caltrans Demo Database.

For any questions regarding the earmarks on [this list][1], contacts <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/dlae.htm" target="_blank">your DLAE</a> or the earmark applicant.
