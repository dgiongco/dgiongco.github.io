For agencies with work that encroaches State facilities, the new Standards were recently announced on the [Caltrans Office Engineer Site][1] and are now available for [purchase][2]:

> The new [2010 Standards][3] have now been published. Please take a moment to review the new format of the documents, or take a look at the [quick guide][4] to see an overview of the changes that the 2010 standards are bringing. Expect to see the first projects using the new format advertised sometime this fall.

The year may be misleading, but the current edition of the Standards is dated 2010.  The 2010 Standards must be used on all projects on or encroaching State facilities.

As an important note: Local agency projects NOT encroaching or on State facilities may use either the 2010 Standards or the existing 2006 Standards boilerplate.
