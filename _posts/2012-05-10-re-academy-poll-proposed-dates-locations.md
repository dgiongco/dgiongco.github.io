The Division of Local Programs (DLA) has provided the following **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">tentative</span>** dates and locations for the Resident Engineers Academy for this year:

*   RE Academy #1 &#8211; Sacramento &#8211; July 16th &#8211; 19th
*   RE Academy #2 &#8211; Fresno &#8211; August 13th &#8211; 16th
*   RE Academy #3 &#8211; Los Angeles &#8211; September 24th &#8211; 27th
*   RE Academy #4 &#8211; Oakland &#8211; October 8th &#8211; 11th or October 15th &#8211; 18th

Although the dates are during busiest parts of the construction season, the training can still be very beneficial to staff administering Federal-aid projects and are able to attend.

To assess if there will be adequate interest in the RE Academy this year, please participate in the poll below by May 15. Results will be shared with DLA to help communicate interest in the proposed dates and locations.

**Thanks for your participation in advance and please remember that these dates and locations are tentative. Â **
