*Updated 11/25/14: The implementation date for the new policies and procedures is being discussed further. The post has been updated to reflect the date has yet to be determined.*

In an email sent to Public Work Directors, Ray Zhang, Chief of Division of Local Assistance, provided notice of upcoming DBE program changes:

> On October 2, 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) published a final rule amending 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 26 and the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program.
>  
> The final rule makes important changes to the implementation of the DBE program regulations.  The major changes that will affect your Federal-aid transportation projects are:
>  
> * DBE Trucking Participation – Allows a DBE firm to take credit for the total value of the hauling services even when the DBE firm’s drivers use trucks leased from non-DBE truck leasing company.  
> * Uniform Report of DBE Awards or Commitments and Payments – Adds requirement to report payments made to DBEs on ongoing contracts during the reporting period.
> * Contract/Subcontract language – Requires agencies to include assurance language in contracts and prime contractors to insert assurance language into subcontracts with DBEs.
> * Additional Guidance on Good Faith Efforts:
> 	* Provides additional examples of actions taken by bidders that may be considered when evaluating good faith efforts.
> 	* Requires bidder to submit good faith effort documentation to the agency no later than 7 days after bid opening.  The 7 days is shortened to 5 days on January 1, 2016.
> 	* For substitutions of DBE firms after contract award, requires good faith effort documentation to be submitted to the agency within 7 days of the request for substitution.  
>  
> We are working with Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) and developing an Local Assistance Office Bulletin that will provide detailed procedural directions to implementing the aforementioned changes, including a reasonable transition dates for implementing these changes.
>  
> Additional information about the modifications to the DBE program can be found at U.S. DOT’s [“DBE Final Rule – Program Implementation Modifications”](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-10-02/pdf/2014-23173.pdf).

The office bulletin hasn't been issued yet, but FHWA and the [Office of Business and Employment Opportunity (OBEO)](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/bep/)[^obeo] have communicated that program changes will need to be implemented on projects <s>**advertised after December 15, 2014**</s>[^transition] TBD. One of the key documents to be included with the office bulletin will be an updated [LAPM Exhibit 12-G, *Required Federal-aid Contract Language*](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/lam/forms/chapter12/12G-2013-08-12.docx). It will be revised to include the required DBE provisions for incorporation into all federal-aid contracts.

[^obeo]: Administrator for the state DBE program.

[^transition]: Final Rule changes actually became effective November 3, 2014. <s>The December 15, 2014 date was approved by FHWA and OBEO to allow local agencies to transition to the DBE program amendments.</s> An implementation date for local agencies has yet to be determined as of the time of this post.
