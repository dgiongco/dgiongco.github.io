Have you ever wondered what that code associated with your project authorization and Finance Letter was?

The program codes correspond to the year and federal transportation bill the funds originate from. We try to obligate the oldest funds first, but depending on available balances at time of authorization, you may see a variety of program codes even though you only have one type of federal fund for your project. Here's a helpful table that provides a quick reference:

| Program Code | Federal Fiscal Years | 
|:-------------:|:--------------------:|
|H_ _ _      |FY2004 – FY2005       |
|L_ _ _      |FY2006 – FY2009       |
|L_ _ E     |FY2010 – FY2012       |
|M_ _ _       |FY2013 – FY2014       |
