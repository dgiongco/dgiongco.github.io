A page was recently added to the DLA website to provide information to local agencies about the [repurposing of earmarks FY 2016](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/earmark/2016/FHWA_Earmarks_Repurposing_Guidance.pdf). In addition, a [letter from DLA](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/earmark/2016/2016-Earmark-Repurposing-Information-Update-Ray-Z.pdf) has been issued to local agencies to provide an update.
