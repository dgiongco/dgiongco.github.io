title: DBE Contract Goal Setting Methodology
date: 2015-05-11

> *The goal methodology was [updated on August 30, 2018](http://www.localassistanceblog.com/2018/08/30/dbe-contract-goal-methodology-update/). Effective **October 1, 2018**, the methodology will require inclusion of work that results in a search of **seven (7)** or more available DBEs (previously 10). The factor for that work applied will now be **80%** (previously 60%).*

One aspect of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program that I've received a lot of inquiries about is contract goal setting. To help understand the task better, I've put together this video to help explain how to calculate a DBE goal for your Local Assistance projects. In the video, I use an example to demonstrate the seven steps to use when setting DBE contract goals:

1. Classify work
2. Determine work category codes
3. Search the CUCP database
4. Apply DBE factors
5. Calculate a soft goal
6. Apply 60% factor
7. Round to the nearest whole percent
