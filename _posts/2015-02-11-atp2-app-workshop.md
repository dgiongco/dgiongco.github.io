## Preparations for the upcoming workshop:

* Between now and this workshop, ATP stakeholders are encouraged to continue reviewing the Caltrans draft Application for Cycle 2, Caltrans draft LAPG Chapter 22 - interim Guidelines, and other program information.   These documents are located on the Caltrans ATP website at:  [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/atp/index.html](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/atp/index.html)
* Between now and the workshop, Caltrans will be focused on revising the Cycle 2 Application form and Chapter 22 based on 1) the comments received from the ATP stakeholders, 2) the latest draft of the CTC Guidelines, 3) lessons learned from Cycle 1 applications, eligibility reviews, and project delivery issues.
* Prior to the workshop on the 25th (hopefully by February 20th), Caltrans intends to share revised drafts of the Application Form and Chapter 22 with stakeholders for the opportunity to review prior to the workshop
* The last few days prior to the workshop, ATP stakeholders are encouraged to review the next draft Application to confirm their past comments have been addressed and consider any new comments. 
* ATP Stakeholders are encouraged to bring new comments to the workshop on the 25th.  Caltrans expects to discuss both past and new comments at the workshop.   Due to time constraints, Caltrans requests stakeholders submit minor text changes in writing at the meeting or as a follow-up to the meeting no later than March 5th.
