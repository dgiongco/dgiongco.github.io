As the first cycle wraps up with the final task of adopting the [MPO component](http://davidgiongco.com/mpo-component-rec.html), I'll be transitioning back to Caltrans. My next assignment will be with the Division of a Local Assistance,  Office of Policy Development and Quality Assurance. My primary focus for the next couple of months will be improving the [Disadvantaged Business Enterprise](http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/DBE_CRLC.html) program for local agencies.

It has been a quick year since [heading to HQ](http://davidgiongco.com/heading-to-hq.html) to work on the [Active Transportation Program (ATP)](http://www.catc.ca.gov/programs/ATP.htm). I've enjoyed the challenging and rewarding experience from both the Department and Commission's perspective[^agencies]. From anticipating the [Governor's approval of Senate Bill 99](http://davidgiongco.com/sb-99-creating-the-atp.html), to participating in multiple [workgroup and subgroup meetings](http://davidgiongco.com/atp-workgroup-meetings.html), to [drafting](http://davidgiongco.com/preliminary-draft-atp-guidelines-posted.html) and [finalizing](http://davidgiongco.com/2014-atp-guidelines-adopted.html) guidelines, to [evaluating](http://davidgiongco.com/2014-atp-applications-log.html) and [recommending](http://davidgiongco.com/2014-atp-staff-recommendations.html) projects for the 2014 program, it's been an awesome opportunity collaborating with various stakeholders to launch the ATP.

I try to vary the topics I post, but just as you may have noticed when I started working on the ATP, I tend to write/share more about information that I'm actively working on. Even more so when I'm getting up to speed with a new assignment or project ... so heads-up :-)

[^agencies]: I initially spent three months with the Caltrans team and then joined the CTC staff to work on the new program.
