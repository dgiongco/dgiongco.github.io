FHWA [published](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00550/national-performance-management-measures-assessing-pavement-condition-for-the-national-highway) Performance Management Final Rules required for the National Highway Performance Program:

> On Thursday, January 18, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) released copies of the final rules for the last two national performance management measure regulations. One rule establishes regulations to assess the condition and performance of bridges on the NHS and of pavements on the Interstate and non-Interstate NHS. The other establishes regulations to assess the performance of the National Highway System (NHS), Freight Movement on the Interstate System, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program.

Additional information regarding the implementation of these new requirements[^dates] will be coming soon, but until then you could register for FHWA's [January webinar](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/exit.cfm?link=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pm2-final-rule-webinar-registration-30954127629) and checkout their [FAQs](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tpm/rule/pm2_faq.pdf).

[^dates]: The rule becomes effective February 17, 2017 and the first performance reports states will be due October 1, 2018.
