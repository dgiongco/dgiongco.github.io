The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II (Extension Act), title I of Public Law 112-30, extended Federal-aid highway program funding through March 31, 2012. FHWA plans to award funding available for these programs under the six-month extension. If additional FY 2012 funding for these programs is provided, FHWA intends to subsequently award these additional program funds based upon responses to this solicitation, if merited by the applications that are received.  
Listed below are the approximate amounts of funding currently available (including any carryover funding from previous years) for the 12 discretionary grant programs. The actual amount available for award in each program is subject to change pending final calculations of Federal-aid highway program funding distributions or any additional funding provided by Congress.
