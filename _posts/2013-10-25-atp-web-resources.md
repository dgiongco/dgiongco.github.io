The California Transportation Commission (CTC) is still in the process of the developing guidelines for the Active Transportation Program (ATP), but several web resources have been recently created to provide information about the program.

## [CTC ATP Site][1]

This [page][1] provides information about the ATP Workgroup meetings that the CTC has created. The posted files include meeting dates/times, agendas, and minutes.

## [Division of Local Assistance ATP Site][2]

The office I work in also created a [page][2] for ATP information. The site will become more helpful as guidelines become finalized, but for now, bookmark the site as it will be a primary method for sharing program information and resources.

## Legislation

Here are links to the to the two Bills that created the program:

*   [Senate Bill 99 (Chapter 359, Statutes of 2013)][3]
*   [Assembly Bill 101 (Chapter 354, Statutes of 2013)][4]

You could also check out my recent [screencast][5] for general program information.
