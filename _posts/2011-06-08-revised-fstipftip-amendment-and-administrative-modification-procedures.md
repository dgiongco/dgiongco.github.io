To streamline and shorten some of the programming requirements that affect project delivery, Caltrans, FHWA, and FTA have revised FSTIP/FTIP Administration Modification and Amendment Procedures.  One of the notable changes is that MPOs can now apply for delegated authority to approve administrative modifications without the need for state and federal approval.  Check out the memo below for other improvements.
