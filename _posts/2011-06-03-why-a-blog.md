title: Why a Blog?
date: 2011-06-03

Of all the ways to get information to our local agencies, a blog is surprisingly not one of them. Other transportation agencies and professionals (including the [U.S. Secretary of Transportation](http://fastlane.dot.gov/) are using blogs effectively to share news and advice ... so why aren't we? That's what motivated me to create a *Local Assistance Blog*. I have to admit that getting support with this idea has been difficult. So I'm launching it personally (my own time and funds) because I hope (and believe) it will be helpful to others.

With the dynamic environment that Local Assistance presents, sharing information is critical to ensuring projects in the state are delivered and compliant with regulations.  My goal is to eventually develop a useful resource that supplements the guidance posted at [Headquarters](http://www.dot.ca.gov/localassistance) and the [Federal Highway Administration](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/federalaid/).

This blog is still under development and will evolve based on visitor input. If you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
