To share announcements and updates from the [District 3 Office of Local Assistance][1] more efficiently, we’ve created a [mailing list][2] for transportation partners to [subscribe][2] to.  
Mailing list subscribers will receive the same messages typically disseminated by Jim Day &#8211; calls for projects, policy and procedure updates, training opportunities, and other important information for successful project delivery &#8211; but additions (and removals) to the contact group will now be managed directly by subscribers through the mailing list<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a>.

## How do I subscribe to the mailing list?

Head over to the [D3LA-Announcements Information Page][2] and enter your email address in the “Subscribing to D3LA-Announcements” section:

[<img height="206" alt="subscribe list" width="600" class="size-full wp-image-1460 " src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/subscribe-list.png" />][2]

After you subscribe on the page, you will receive an email message to confirm your request. Follow the directions in the email to confirm and you’ll be added to the our mailing list.<!--more-->

## Is joining the mailing list the same as subscribing to the Local Assistance Blog?

No, the notifications from the mailing list are separate than the subscriptions to my blog. While many of the topics and information I share here may be similar, the Local Assistance Blog is [not an official][3] Caltrans of FHWA site<a class="footnote" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a>. The [District 3 Office of Local Assistance][1] mailing list will provide official notices from the District Local Assistance Engineer.

There may be some duplicated topics and announcements, but I recommend signing up for both if you haven’t.

## How do I remove myself from the mailing list?

If you ever want to unsubscribe from the mailing list, simply visit the [D3LA-Announcements Information Page][2] and enter your email address at the bottom of the page to be removed:

[<img height="61" alt="unsubscribe list" width="600" class="size-full wp-image-1461 " src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/unsubscribe-list.png" />][2]

Communication is key in the Local Assistance world. Hopefully, this new [mailing list][2] will help many in the region stay informed.

[^1]:    Individuals currently on Jim Day’s distribution list have been imported into the new mailing list and should have received a welcome message confirming subscription. If you’d like to removed from the list, please following the instructions above.

[^2]:    The posts I put together here aren&#8217;t sent to mailing list subscribers. They&#8217;re primarily put together in the hopes to provide advice, rather than serve as announcement. While not an official site, I still think some may find my blog helpful :-)
