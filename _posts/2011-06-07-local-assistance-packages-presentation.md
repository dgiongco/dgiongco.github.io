A couple of months ago, I met with one of my agencies and presented some general tips that I thought would be helpful when preparing their various packages/requests. Â Although my presentation provides a quick list of documents to provide, engineers should still check with their assigned Local Assistance Area Engineer and the LAPM for the requirements for their project.
