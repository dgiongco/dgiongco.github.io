[Buy America][1] has been a hot topic since MAP&#8211;21 became effective and, if you&#8217;ve been following my site, I&#8217;ve written about it [many times][2]. One aspect of the required provision, however, that I haven&#8217;t covered in much detail is field compliance.

To provide information about Buy America certification, I&#8217;m sharing FHWA&#8217;s helpful [Federal-aid Essentials][3] video:
