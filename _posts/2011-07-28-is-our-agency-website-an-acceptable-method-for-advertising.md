The topic of advertising contracts around the office has been popular this week.  One question regarding the topic has been advertising on an agency&#8217;s website.  I&#8217;ve been asked if it&#8217;s acceptable for federally funded projects.

Provided that all interested bidders are notified about the website, Internet advertising is acceptable for Federal-aid projects, but as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>supplement</strong></span> to traditional means.  Newspaper advertisement of contract proposals is the most common method accepted by FHWA to announce projects.  Other acceptable forms of advertisement can be made in widely-circulated trade journals, bulletins, and mailing lists to potential bidders.

For additional information, refer to <a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/lam/prog_p/p15adwrd06-10-11.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 15 of the LAPM</a> and the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/contracts/cacc.pdf" target="_blank">Contract Administration Core Curriculum</a>..
