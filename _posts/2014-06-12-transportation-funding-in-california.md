Understanding transportation funding in California can be overwhelming with the multiple fund sources, programs, and agencies involved. You *could* analyze the infamous [Chart C][1] to see how our state&#8217;s transportation system is funded, but fortunately the [Economic Analysis Branch][2] at Caltrans puts together the [&#8220;Transportation Funding in California&#8221;][3] guide. The guide provides a transportation funding overview by summarizing topics such as state and federal funding sources, key decision makers, and programming.

If you or someone you know wants to learn more about transportation funding, this is a resource I recommend checking out to help get started.
