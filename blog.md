In 2011, I created a blog to share news, advice, and resources about delivering federal and state-funded transportation projects in California. The topics I shared varied from local programs policy and procedure updates to my observations working with local agencies and their projects.

It was initially met with skepticism, but I believed it would provide value to those agency representatives I worked with and I pressed on building a site and putting together posts. What started with a few followers from one agency evolved into a statewide blog to relay information throughout the state. 

Below is an archive of posts I published on my original site. I did my best to share the most accurate and current information available. There, however, may be mistakes, and with the constantly evolving environment of transportation funding and policies, some details may have become inaccurate when a post is read. Also, the blog posts were written and curated by *me*. Any views on this site are represented solely by *me*. They were **NOT** an official publication of the Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), or any other agency or organization.
