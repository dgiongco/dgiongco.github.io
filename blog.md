I created this site in 2011 to serve as a log for my reference, but it has evolved into a platform where I share news, advice, and [resources][1] with others who also work on federal-aid transportation projects. The topics I share vary from local programs policy and procedure updates to my observations working with local agencies and their projects. Here are a few posts that have been frequently visited:

* [Understanding NEPA Reevaluations][2]
* [Why 88.53?][3]
* [DBE Contract Goal Setting Methodology][4]
* [2014 ATP Staff Recommendations][5]

The information shared on this site is written and curated by *me*. Any views on this site are represented solely by *me*.

This site is **NOT** an official publication of the [Department of Transportation][6], [Federal Highway Administration][7], [California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)][8], or any other agency or organization.

I do my best to share the most accurate and current information available. There, however, may be mistakes, and with the constantly evolving environment of transportation funding and policies, some details may have become inaccurate by the time a post is read.
